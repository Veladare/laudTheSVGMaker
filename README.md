## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a graphic design by fill out a questionnaire. By doing this, user will be able to create a image without the need to pay for a graphic designer. 

In completing this project, I gained a better understanding of how to use classes and how to extend those classes into other classes. I learned how to perform test, not only to ensure that my code works properly, but also to have a greater understanding of how my code works. 
## Installation 

To use, install npm and npm inquirer in VScode or similiar program

## Usage

Once installed, fill out the questionnaire that appears when user enters node index.js into the intergrated terminal.
